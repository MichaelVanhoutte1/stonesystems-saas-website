First, evaluate how well your content is optimized and whether your search engine visibility has improved over the past month. Check if the volume of your ranked keywords has increased, and stay updated on any Google algorithm changes that might affect your site. Ensure your keywords accurately reflect your products or services. Lastly, focus on nurturing “low-hanging fruit”—keywords and pages with growth potential but currently lower rankings—to boost your overall SEO.',
