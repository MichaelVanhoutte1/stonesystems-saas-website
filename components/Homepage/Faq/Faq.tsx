              This will completely depend on what else you're doing for advertising, how long you've
              been in business, the quality of your work, and of course that you commit to using our
              system. If you think you're going to close your eyes and pay us $297/month a month to
              solve all your problems, we’re probably not the right fit for you. We cannot stress
              this enough... you have to be doing multiple forms of advertising. Stone Systems is
              meant to provide you a simple, yet extremely effective foundational marketing system
              to help grow and expand your business. We’re here to build your online business
              foundation, not perform miracles. <br />

                1. Do you believe having more 5 star reviews will attract more customers? <br />
                <br />

                more professional, therefore leading to more business? <br />
                <br />
                4. Do you believe making sure you're making the most of every customer you work with

                work with you again <br />

              We make sure every Stone Systems website is set up for Google with the best SEO
              practices. This includes keyword research, adding alt tags, meta tags, and header
              titles, securing an SSL certificate, optimizing for a high Google Speed test score,
              and providing regular updates. Your Google ranking will depend on how long your site’s
              been live, local competition, and factors like your Google My Business reviews. We
              also offer blogging to boost your content. While we don’t handle off-page backlinks
              beyond your social media, our ongoing updates keep your site in great shape—unlike
              some developers who set up your site and then forget about it.

              We might be a bit biased, but here’s the deal: if each of your customers brings in
              about $500 a year, getting just 2-4 new customers from your website will pay off. We
              know you’ll see great value from your site. It will help you attract new customers,
              make it easier for existing customers to refer you, allow you to run ads if you want,
              and attract bigger clients who value professionalism.
