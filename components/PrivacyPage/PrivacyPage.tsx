          <Text className={classes.text}>
            Our business customers use the App to text and call their own leads from a business
            phone number that we provision for them. Those messages are sent by the business, not by
            Stone Systems; the business is responsible for having the consent it needs to contact
            its leads. Every conversation honors opt-out keywords automatically: a lead who replies{' '}
            <strong>STOP</strong> (or a similar keyword such as UNSUBSCRIBE or CANCEL) is
            unsubscribed from that business&apos;s number and receives no further texts from it
            unless they opt back in by replying <strong>START</strong> or <strong>UNSTOP</strong>.
            Message frequency depends on the lead&apos;s conversation with the business. Standard
            message and data rates apply. Messages are delivered by our telephony carrier, Signal
            House, solely to transmit them.
